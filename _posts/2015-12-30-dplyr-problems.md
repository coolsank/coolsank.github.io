title: dplyr problems

### Arrggh!
To think that it would easy in the beginning was just being too optimistic of me. Take up a simple project that needs to be implmeneted in R, and I can't even get the libraries installed in R Studio. 

dplyr has ruined me :(

After googling and stackoverflowing for more than a few minutes, my attempt at installing from the source and binaries (I'm a newbie to this) got me nowhere. And then, waalah, RStudio has a magical option for installing packages through its GUI. Why didn't I think of looking there earlier? Never mind, the job's done.

Time for dataaaaiinnggg !
